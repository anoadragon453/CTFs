It seems as though we were going about it wrong... XOR-ing two messages does not give us the stream. However, if we XOR two encrypted messages, then perform crib dragging with a common word like "the" we can find the position of that word. So the best thing to do would be to XOR that 11th text with another one of similar length, then make a program to crib drag every english word accross it to reconstruct the message.
